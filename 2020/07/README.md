## Mass balance under non-steady-state conditions, 8 Jun - 14 Jun

#### Introduction

We have already learnt about different the use cases of well-known material balace equation: 

accumulation = in - out ± reaction.

Class03 - accumulation was equal to 0, there was no reaction, so we used the equation in a simplified, algebraic form: 

0 = in - out

Class06 - there was reaction(s) and accumulation was not equal to 0, but the system was closed (in, out = 0), so we used the equation in a form: 

accumulation = ± reaction 

(note: accumulation means e.g. rate of production of a reaction product P, dP/dt).

This module focuses on mass balance under non-steady-state conditions without reaction, i.e. accumulation, in, out ≠ 0:

accumulation = in - out
