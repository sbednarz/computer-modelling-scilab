### Exercise 1

Suppose an elementary reaction A => B, plot concentration of A and B versus reaction time ranged from 0 to 200s if k=2.5e-2 1/s and initial concentrations A<sub>0</sub> = 0.5 mol/L and B<sub>0</sub> = 0.1 mol/L. Please '''use ode function.

### Exercise 2

Suppose an equilibrium process A => B k<sub>1</sub>, B => A k<sub>2</sub>. Plot concentration of A and B versus reaction time ranged from 0 to 200s if k<sub>1</sub>=k<sub>2</sub>=2.5e-2 1/s and initial concentrations A<sub>0</sub> = 0.5 mol/L and B<sub>0</sub> = 0 mol/L. What is approx. time needed to reach the equilibria by the system (look at the plot)?

### Exercise 3

Let's consider an equilibrium process 2A=>B k<sub>1</sub>, B=>A k<sub>2</sub>. Plot concentration of A and B versus reaction time ranged from 0 to 10000s  if k<sub>1</sub> = 1e-3 1/s k<sub>2</sub> = 1e-4 1/s and initial concentrations A<sub>0</sub> = 0 mol/L and B<sub>0</sub> = 0.6 mol/L. What is initial rate of the process (t=0s)? What is the final rate (t=10000s)?
