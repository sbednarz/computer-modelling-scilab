### Exercise 1

Suppose an elementary reaction A=>B, plot concentration of A and B versus reaction time ranged from 0 to 200 s if k=2.5e-2 1/s and initial concentrations A0 = 0.5 mol/L and B0 = 0.1 mol/L.

### Exercise 2

Suppose an equilibrium process A=>B k1, B=>A k2. Plot concentration of A and B versus reaction time ranged from 0 to 200 s if k1=k2=2.5e-2 1/s and initial concentrations A0 = 0.5 mol/L and B0 = 0 mol/L. What is approx. time needed to reach the equilibria by the system (look at the plot)?

### Exercise 3

Suppose an equilibrium process 2A=>B k1, B=>A k2. Plot concentration of A and B versus reaction time ranged from 0 to 10 000 s s if k1 = 1e-3 1/s k2 = 1e-4 1/s and initial concentrations A0 = 0 mol/L and B0 = 0.6 mol/L. What is initial rate of the process? What is the final rate (t=10 000s)?
