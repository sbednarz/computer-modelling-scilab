### Exercise 1

A) Mixture of 220 kmol/h of ethane and 500 kmol/h of chlorine is reacted in a rector: 

C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> &#8594; C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Cl + HCl

C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Cl + Cl<sub>2</sub> &#8594; C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> + HCl

C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> &#8594; C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub> + HCl


The exit stream contains 50 kmol/h monochloroethane, 50 kmol/h dichloroethane, 100 kmol/h trichloroethane, as well as unknown amounts of hydrogen chloride, ethane and chlorine. Solve the problem using the atomic species balance approach.

B) Assuming that the reactor is fed by 400 kmol/h of ethane and 200 kmol/h of chlorine, and extent of the first, second and third reactions is 100, 50, 20, respectively, calculate the exit stream composition (note: building and solving of a equations system is not necessary). 

### Exercise 2

Consider a continuous steady-state process of polymerization with recycle of an unreacted monomer (scheme):

Monomer  &#8594; Polymer

Conversion ùõº of the monomer into the polymer in the reactor (R) is 30% per pass. Unreacted monomer is seperated and mixed (M) with a fresh monomer stream F<sub>M</sub>. Calculate flow of the recycled
stream assuming ideal separation of the polymer in the separator (S).
