### Computer Modelling in Chemical Technology: Scilab worked examples

#### MINIPROJECTS

```scilab
Submit your soulutions (Scilab code only) to: sbednarz@pk.edu.pl
Comment your code to provide additional informations (if necessary).

Deadline: 

1 June 2019 (the first group) 

30 June 2019 (the second group).

```
---


##### Miniproject 1

```scilab
Carry out the analysis of model of extraction (Example 2.3):
How K impacts to recovery factor (r)?  
What is influence of amount of org solvent used (F2) on r?
Prepare plots to ilustrate your answers.
Try to use Scilab loops to organise your calculations.
```

##### Miniproject 2

```scilab
Consider esterification process of mixture of ethanol and 1-propanol by acetic acid:

EtOH + CH3COOH <=> CH3COOEt + H2O, K1

PrOH + CH3COOH <=> CH3COOPr + H2O, K2

Calculate equilibrium concentrations of reagents if K1 = 6 and K2 = 4 and 
initial concentrations of substrates are: 
cCH3COOH = 3 mol/L
cEtOH = 7 mol/L
cPrOH = 6 mol/L

Build model of the system using of extent of reaction approach.
Study effect of water in the initial mixture to concentrations of esters at equilibria (plot).
Try to use Scilab loops to collect data needed.
```

##### Miniproject 3

```scilab 
Based on a video material: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqPO5UUxO_Y 
develop a model of the system using Scilab (system of ODEs), and solve the problem numerically. 
Plot D(t) and E(t) for t ranged from 0 to 4h.
What are final concentrations of D and E?
```
