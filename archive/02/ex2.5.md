Consider a continuous steady-state process of polymerization with recycle of an unreacted monomer (scheme).
Fractional conversion of the monomer to polymer alpha in the reactor (R) is 60% per pass. 
Calculate flow of the recycled stream of the monomer 
if the polymer separated in the separator (S) contains 5% of the monomer.
