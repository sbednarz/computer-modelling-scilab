Consider a continuous steady-state process of polymerization with recycle of an unreacted monomer (scheme). 
Fractional conversion (alpha) of the monomer into the polymerin the reactor (R) is 30% per pass. 
Calculate flow of the recycled stream assuming ideal separation of the polymer in the separator (S).
